# Swatch-Neer
## The Problem Statement:
Nowadays due to urbanization and industrial development, there is huge contamination of water bodies. This leads to water pollution and the death of aquatic life. The increased levels of particulate matter in water bodies decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen in water, posing a threat to water animals and the trash disposal decreases the cleanliness and sanity of the water bodies.
## Solution:
This problem can be resolved by making a bot which can remove the waste and check the pollution level in the water bodies. This robot is remote-operated. The bot helps in finding ppm using a TDS meter and pH of water bodies by IOT and modern, innovative technology. The bot collects plastic and other noticeable waste from the water bodies. A net is used to collect the garbage. A water cleaning bot is a small helping hand to the people who clean the water bodies manually. It reduces their time.
## Components Used:
 1. Arduino Uno microcontroller
 2. Arduino Nano
 3. MG996R Servo Motor
 4. TDS Meter
 5. L293D Motor Driver
 6. HC 05 Bluetooth Module
 7. ESP32 CAM
 8. Center Shaft DC Motor
 9. Nests
## Technologies Used:
 1. Arduino IDE
 2. Fritzing
 3. Fusion 360
## Result:
When the bot is released into the water, with the help of a servo the waste materials are collected and dumped into the waste bin which is located above the bot. This bot is controlled by Bluetooth transmission.
## Future enhancement: 
 The Swatch Neer can be further extended by adding sensors to make it autonomous without any need for human involvement to control it.
## Conclusion:
Finally, we conclude that our bot (swach neer) which is operated by remote control is a small helping hand to those who clean water bodies manually as it    takes much less effort for a person to use a robot than a person working himself to clean the water body. This reduces manpower and is environmentally friendly.
